[WIP] The website will be here: [ridedirs.com](https://www.ridedirs.com)

# Description
This project is a website for ORF 401 Spring 2021 at Princeton.
The purpose is to create a website that allows users to find rides heading to and from an event and find opportunities to carpool. This service would help users who do not have access to a personal motor vehicle and also helps to reduce the carbon footprint of evects.

# Cool interpretations of the name: ridedirs
-almost a palindrome which is kinda symbolic since we are planning to deal with going to and returning from an event.
-Can be interpreted as a ride-directory like a directory for rides and/or ride-direction since people are going to and from an event.
-ridedirs sounds like “riders” that suggest multiple occupants in a vehicle.
