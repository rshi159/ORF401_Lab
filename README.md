[WIP] The website will be here [Live]: [ridedirs.com](www.ridedirs.com)
[WIP] Heroku site [Live]: [link] [ridedirs.com](https://young-crag-30528.herokuapp.com/add_ride/)

*Still having issue with adding rides to the website. The issue is not replicated on localhost. The add_ride page returns an invalid 
form/invalid person error. Current behavior is to start a new form when an invalid form is submitted, so no new rides can currently
be added. May need to check with Zak on this. Suspect something to do with configuration files or hard-coded path.

# Description
This project is a website for ORF 401 Spring 2021 at Princeton.
The purpose is to create a website that allows users to find rides heading to and from an event and find opportunities to carpool. This service would help users who do not have access to a personal motor vehicle and also helps to reduce the carbon footprint of evects.

# Cool interpretations of the name: ridedirs
-almost a palindrome which is kinda symbolic since we are planning to deal with going to and returning from an event.
-Can be interpreted as a ride-directory like a directory for rides and/or ride-direction since people are going to and from an event.
-ridedirs sounds like “riders” that suggest multiple occupants in a vehicle.
