# Description
This project is a website for ORF 401 Spring 2021 at Princeton.
The purpose is to create a website that allows users to find rides heading to and from an event and find opportunities to carpool. This service would help users who do not have access to a personal motor vehicle and also helps to reduce the carbon footprint of evects.
